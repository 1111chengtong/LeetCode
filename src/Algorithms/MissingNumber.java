/**
 * Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.
 *
 * Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?
 *
 *  
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: nums = [0]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
