/**
 * There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.
 *
 * A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
 *
 * You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
 *
 * Return the total number of provinces.
 *
 *  
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
 * Output: 3
 *  
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 200
 * n == isConnected.length
 * n == isConnected[i].length
 * isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
 * isConnected[i][i] == 1
 * isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]
